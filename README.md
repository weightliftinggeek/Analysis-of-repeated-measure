# Description
This porfolio showcases 3 projects of repeated measures datasets used commonly in many disciplines including health, psychology, economics and biology.  
The projects require appropriate statistical analysis in a repeated measures data environment by using models such as the linear mixed model, correlated random effects model and marginal model.  
R statistical package is used.

## Cognitive
Twenty-four subjects were selected at random and were categorised according to their education level (high school, undergraduate, postgraduate).
The subjects read two types of words (form and colour) under two cue conditions (normal and congruent)
and the order in which the four reading tasks were carried out was randomised. The time in milliseconds for
completing each reading task was recorded, on each subject.
## Postnal
Women with major depression which began within 3
months of child-birth were randomly assigned to the treatment group or to the placebo group. The treatment
group consisted of patients using the Estrogen patch and the placebo group was made up of patients using the
Placebo patch. The women were assessed pre-treatment (directly before administration of the treatment) and
at post-treatment (1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months and 6 months after the administration
of the treatment), using the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). This scale ranges from 0 to 30
and a score of at least 10 is regarded as possible depression.
## Veneer
A study was conducted on the teeth of 25 adults to examine gingival (gum) health.
